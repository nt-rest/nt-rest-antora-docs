				<h1>History</h1>

<h2 id="_long_story_short"><a class="anchor" href="#_long_story_short"></a>Long Story Short</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had an interesting problem to solve in early December 2019.
The problem was complete lack of usable printing APIs for mobile platforms.
We had tried a few solutions.
Vendor supplied mobile drivers were terrible at best.
Hardly working, support only a limited set of network printer models.
Printer discovery was impossible, if a printer is in another subnet.
Not a good thing if you are connecting through multi-subnet, multi-VLAN enterprise network.
We had to come up with a better solution.
That  specific task of printing was successfully addressed by adding a few methods to a completely unrelated ASP.Net web-service and using GDI APIs (Architecture? What architecture?!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless the very problem of printing from mobile device kept my mind busy.
I had quickly realized that I had made a lot of &#8220;Can&#8217;t be mobile/web, because printing&#8221; choices through my career.
It felt like something unnatural somehow became pretty usual.
Silly technical limitation became an architecture best practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I began thinking about fixing the problem mid February, and wrote my first code in early March.
Architecture stabilized in June.
It started with printing, but soon I realized that wider specter of APIs should be covered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It did not seem challenging enough at first, so I decided to give a try to a few new languages and see as it goes.
Learning a new language while developing from scratch should be fun.
That is how I have learned Python after all.
Candidates were Beef, D, Go, Rust, and Zig.
To make it more reasonable I have included my old friends like C, C&#43;&#43;, and C#.
But since there is much more of interfacing with operating system APIs, rather than fancy business logic, syntax advantages of new languages became unimportant and API wrapping became a headache.
So I, as a proper nerd, did not consider my gut feeling as a valid reason and have created an exhaustive comparison spreadsheet instead.
I have entered all parameters, their weight, and calculated some overall language performance points.
After all that time I had spent trying out modern languages I decided to return to good old C&#43;&#43;.
But still worth it, it was fun and I have learned something new.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Honestly, it was not easy to recall my C&#43;&#43; knowledge.
Language changed significantly since I used it last time for anything serious.
I decided to go with the latest supported version of the C&#43;&#43; standard.
While my choice is opinionated like any other choice of mine, I believe it is reasonable enough to not regret it soon.
So modern C&#43;&#43; it is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Source code contains mix of proper C&#43;&#43; code based on platform independent standard library, and Windows&#8482; specific code.
These are separated, and platform specific class names are marked with <code>win_</code> prefix.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_name"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_name"></a>The Name</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I believe I came up with the current name on April 12th.
It is NT-REST.
I personally pronounce it like <code>ɛntəɹəst</code>. <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%C9%9Bnt%C9%99%C9%B9%C9%99st&amp;voice=Joanna" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joanna</a>, <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%C9%9Bnt%C9%99%C9%B9%C9%99st&amp;voice=Brian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am not a native English speaker (or any other Germanic language family native speaker), so would love to hear if it sounds weird to anybody.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Name stands for <strong>RE</strong>presentational <strong>S</strong>tate <strong>T</strong>ransfer for Windows&#8482; <strong>NT</strong> but also sounds like word <strong>interest</strong>.
Of course vowel sounds are different, but who cares, it&#8217;s similar enough.
One almost reasonable meaning and one almost funny pun.
Good enough for me to settle with the current name.</p>
