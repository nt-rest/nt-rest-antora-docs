= Fingerprinting
:page-toclevels: 5

Sends fingerprinting information to a fingerprinting server.

Fingerprinting information consists of nine fingerprints, based on model names and serials numbers of various machine components.
If component is replaced, some fingerprints will change, but not all of them.
Each fingerprint is a secure hash of client origin and component data.
In other words, fingerprints for different client origins do not match.
Despite fingerprints are numbered in documentation, no  particular fingerprint order is preserved.
Fingerprints are always sent in a random order.
While fingerprint sources are well defined, is should be impossible to easily deduct which system component changed.
Not all components are always meningful.
Desktops unlike laptops, have no battery, virtual machines BIOS and motherboard are fake.

At least three of nine fingerprint will not change after

If a single component is replaced, exactly three fingerprints change and six remain the same.
If two component are replaced, at most six fingerprints change and three remain the same.
If three component are replaced, all fingerprints may change.

For example::
 * If CPU is replaced, fingerprints #4, #5, #6 will change, but #1, #2, #3, #7, #8, #9 will remain the same.
 * If RAM module is installed, fingerprints #3, #6, #9 will change, but #1, #2, #4, #5, #7, #8 will remain the same.
