= General Notes

NT-REST as a commercial project, but is not closed source.
However, it is not completely open source either by https://www.fsf.org/[Free Software Foundation^] or https://opensource.org/[Open Source Initiative^] definition. It is may be called delayed open source, or source available.

We have adopted two licenses. Anything in `sources` and `graphics` directories, is licensed under enterprise friendly xref:bsl-11.adoc[], just like the source code of other popular commercial projects: MariaDB, CockroachDB, Sentry, etc.
Everything else, including but not limited to `examples` directory, is licensed under very liberal xref:unlicense.adoc[].

xref:bsl-11.adoc[] was created by David Axmark and Michael Widenius to provide a mutually beneficial balance between the user benefits of true Open Source software that is free of cost and provides open access to all of the product code for modification, distribution, etc., and the sustainability needs of software developers to continue delivering product innovation and maintenance.

Source code of the project itself is available right now, can be used for non-production right now and will eventually become relicensed under xref:licensing:bsd-4.adoc[].
Read https://mariadb.com/bsl-faq-adopting/[BSL FAQ^] to address any questions.
If you want to review, compare, benchmark or anything similar, feel free to reference the source code.

Source code of the examples is public domain.

If you need anything not explicitly allowed or even prohibited by xref:licensing:bsl-11.adoc[] or simply feel confused, never hesitate to mailto:licensing@nt-rest.com[write us^], we will try to be friendly and make a personal exception.
