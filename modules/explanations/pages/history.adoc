== Long Story Short

I had an interesting problem to solve in early December 2019.
The problem was complete lack of usable printing APIs for mobile platforms.
We had tried a few solutuons.
HP(TM) and Canon(TM) mobile drivers were terrible at best.
Hardly working, support only a limited set of network printer models.
Printer discovery was impossible, if printer is in another subnet.
Not a good thing if you are connecting through multi-subnet, multi-VLAN enterprise network.
We had to come up with a better solution.
That  specific task of printing was successufully addressed by adding a few methods to a completely unrelated ASP.Net web-service and using GDI APIs (Architecture? What architecture?!).

Nevertheless the very problem of printing from mobile device kept my mind busy.
I had quickly realized that I had made a lot of "`Can't be mobile/web, because printing`" choices through my career.
It felt like something unnatural somehow became pretty usual.

I began thinking about fixing the problem mid February, and wrote my first code in early March.
Architecture stabilized in June.
It started with printing, but soon I realized that wider specter of APIs should be covered.

It did not seem challenging enough at first, so I decided to give a try to a few new languages and see as it goes.
Learning a new language while developing from scratch should be fun.
That is how I have learned Python after all.
Candidates were Beef, D, Go, Rust, and Zig.
To make it more reasonable I have included my old friends like C, C{plus}{plus}, and C#.
But since there is much more of interfacing with operating system APIs, rather than fancy business logic, syntax advantages of new languages became unimportant and API wrapping became a headache.
So I, as a proper nerd, did not consider my gut feeling as a valid reason and have created an exhaustive comparison spreadsheet instead.
I have entered all parameters, their weight, and calculated some overall language performance points.
After all that time I had spent trying out modern languages I decided to return to good old C{plus}{plus}.
But still worth it, it was fun and I have learned something new.

Honestly, it was not easy to recall my C{plus}{plus} knowledge.
Language changed significantly since I used it last time for anything serious.
I decided to go with the latest supported version of the C{plus}{plus} standard.
While my choice is opinionated like any other choice of mine, I believe it is reasonable enough to not regret it soon.
So modern C{plus}{plus} it is.

Source code contains mix of proper C{plus}{plus} code based on platform independent standard library, and Windows(TM) specific code.
These are separated, and platform specific class names are marked with `win_` prefix.

== Dependencies

NT-REST depends on https://sqlite.org/index.html[SQLite^] for persistent storage and on https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/[jsoncons^] for JSON parsing.

While not external dependencies by definition but operating system components, it's worth mentioning that NT-REST depends on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/i-o-completion-ports[I/O Completion Ports^], https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/http/http-api-start-page[HTTP Server API^] and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/websock/web-socket-protocol-component-api-portal[WebSocket Protocol Component API^].

== The Name

I believe I came up with the current name on April 12th.
It is NT-REST.
I personally pronounce it like `ɛntəɹəst`. http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%C9%9Bnt%C9%99%C9%B9%C9%99st&voice=Joanna[Joanna^], http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%C9%9Bnt%C9%99%C9%B9%C9%99st&voice=Brian[Brian^].

I am not a native English speaker (or any other Germanic language family native speaker), so would love to hear if it sounds weird to anybody.

Name stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer for Windows(TM) **NT** but also sounds like word *interest*.
Of course vowel sounds are different, but who cares, it's similar enough.
One almost reasonable meaning and one almost funny pun.
Good enough for me to settle with the current name.
